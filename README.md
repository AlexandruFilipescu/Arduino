# Arduino ESP32 S3 feather pinout
In this tutorial, we want to highlight how to use the input and output pins, as well as some explanatory examples.

## What is a pinout and GPIO ? 
- A pinout is a diagram showing the arrangement of pins on an integrated circuit and their functions.
- At the most basic level, GPIO refers to a set of pins on your computer’s mainboard or add-on card. These pins can send or receive electrical signals, but they aren’t designed for any specific purpose. This is why they’re called “general-purpose” IO.
